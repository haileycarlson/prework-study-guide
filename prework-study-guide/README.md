# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I was motivated to do this project because I am interested in learning how to code and build web applications. Building this webpage helped me learn different elements of code such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. By building this website I now have what I have learned on a webage so that I can utilize it to remeber what I have learned. Through this project I have learned the rules of each coding language and how they create different elements on my webage. I have also learned how to properly go about any coding projects and how to pull and push different braches. 

## Installation

## Usage

This webpage will be used to study the material of the prework that I have completed. The webpage is divided into four topic named CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Git. In each of the topics there are notes taken from what I have learned about each of them through my prework. I can even use the code written to create the webpage as study material or it can be looked back on when needed. By openeing DevTools it will randomly choose a topic for me to start studying and I can use this to help pick a topic to dive in on.
